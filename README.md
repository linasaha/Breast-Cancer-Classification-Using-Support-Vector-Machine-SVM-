# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM

For this problem, we will use the 'Wisconsin Breast Cancer' data set, which has already been pre-processed and partitioned into training, validation and test sets. Numpy's loadtxt command used to load CSV files.

Scikit-learn's SVC function used to learn SVM models with linear and radial-basis kernels for each combination of  C and  γ

Final Model Selection: Used the validation set to select the best the classifier corresponding to the best parameter values,  Cbest and  γbest.

Accuracy reported on the test set for this selected best SVM model
